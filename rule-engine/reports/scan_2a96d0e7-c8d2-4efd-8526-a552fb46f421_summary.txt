=== DETAILED FINDINGS ===

1. [HIGH] rules.python.django.security.injection.tainted-sql-string
   Location: test.py:24:13
   Details: Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using the Django object-relational mappers (ORM) instead of raw SQL queries.
   CWE: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

2. [HIGH] rules.python.flask.security.injection.tainted-sql-string
   Location: test.py:24:13
   Details: Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an object-relational mapper (ORM) such as SQLAlchemy which will protect your queries.
   CWE: CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

3. [HIGH] rules.python.sqlalchemy.security.sqlalchemy-execute-raw-query
   Location: test.py:25:5
   Details: Avoiding SQL string concatenation: untrusted input concatenated with raw SQL query can result in SQL Injection. In order to execute raw query safely, prepared statement should be used. SQLAlchemy provides TextualSQL to easily used prepared statement with named parameters. For complex SQL composition, use SQL Expression Language or Schema Definition Language. In most cases, SQLAlchemy ORM will be a better option.
   CWE: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

4. [HIGH] rules.python.lang.security.dangerous-system-call
   Location: test.py:33:12
   Details: Found user-controlled data used in a system call. This could allow a malicious actor to execute commands. Use the 'subprocess' module instead, which is easier to use without accidentally exposing a command injection vulnerability.
   CWE: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

5. [HIGH] rules.python.lang.security.audit.dangerous-system-call-audit
   Location: test.py:33:12
   Details: Found dynamic content used in a system call. This is dangerous if external data can reach this function call because it allows a malicious actor to execute commands. Use the 'subprocess' module instead, which is easier to use without accidentally exposing a command injection vulnerability.
   CWE: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

6. [HIGH] rules.python.flask.security.insecure-deserialization
   Location: test.py:39:11
   Details: Detected the use of an insecure deserialization library in a Flask route. These libraries are prone to code execution vulnerabilities. Ensure user data does not enter this function. To fix this, try to avoid serializing whole objects. Consider instead using a serializer such as JSON.
   CWE: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

7. [HIGH] rules.python.flask.security.injection.path-traversal-open
   Location: test.py:52:10

   CWE: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

10. [MEDIUM] rules.java.lang.security.audit.crypto.use-of-md5
   Location: SQLi.java:25:58
   Details: Detected MD5 hash algorithm which is considered insecure. MD5 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable as a cryptographic signature. Use HMAC instead.
   CWE: CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

11. [MEDIUM] rules.python.django.security.injection.raw-html-format
   Location: test.py:46:12
   Details: Detected user input flowing into a manually constructed HTML string. You may be accidentally bypassing secure methods of rendering HTML by manually constructing HTML and this could create a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could let attackers steal sensitive user data. To be sure this is safe, check that the HTML is rendered safely. Otherwise, use templates (`django.shortcuts.render`) which will safely render HTML instead.
   CWE: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

12. [MEDIUM] rules.python.django.security.injection.path-traversal.path-traversal-open
   Location: test.py:51:5
   Details: Found request data in a call to 'open'. Ensure the request data is validated or sanitized, otherwise it could result in path traversal attacks and therefore sensitive data being leaked. To mitigate, consider using os.path.abspath or os.path.realpath or the pathlib library.
   CWE: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

13. [MEDIUM] rules.python.django.security.injection.sql.sql-injection-db-cursor-execute
   Location: test.py:20:5
   Details: User-controlled data from a request is passed to 'execute()'. This could lead to a SQL injection and therefore protected information could be leaked. Instead, use django's QuerySets, which are built with query parameterization and therefore not vulnerable to sql injection. For example, you could use `Entry.objects.filter(date=2006)`.
   CWE: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

14. [MEDIUM] rules.python.django.security.injection.sql.sql-injection-db-cursor-execute

   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

20. [MEDIUM] rules.java.lang.security.audit.unsafe-reflection
   Location: SQLi.java:73:30
   Details: If an attacker can supply values that the application then uses to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, the potential exists for the attacker to create control flow paths through the application that were not intended by the application developers. This attack vector may allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access control checks or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner.
   CWE: CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')
   Remediation: Follow Semgrep recommendations

21. [MEDIUM] rules.python.lang.best-practice.unspecified-open-encoding
   Location: test.py:52:10
   Details: Missing 'encoding' parameter. 'open()' uses device locale encodings by default, corrupting files with special characters. Specify the encoding to ensure cross-platform support when opening files in text mode (e.g. encoding="utf-8").
